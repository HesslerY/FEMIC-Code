# FEMIC-Code
Supplemental for Computer &amp; Geoscience paper entitled "A  Matlab-Based Frequency-Domain Electromagnetic Inversion Code (FEMIC) with Graphical User Interface"

This folder contains three sub folders, one for the FEMIC code ('Code'), the second for the datasets ('datasets'), and the third for Figure 11 ('Figure 11') used in the paper:

- Code: This folder contains the matlab functions to run the code.The FEMIC code can be installed by placing the Code folder where 
accessible via Matlab, opening Matlab, changing the workspace to the Code folder and typing 'start' at the Matlab prompt. A brief user manual
is provided in this folder as a pdf.

- Datasets: This folder contains the datasets used in the paper.
