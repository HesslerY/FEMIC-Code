The WY data folder contains this READ ME file and two additional files for the Wyoming data set in the paper:

1) Input_WY_data.dat: A text (ascii) file containing the input data, with columns of:
- x location in meters
- y location in meters
- z location in meters
- sounding identification (ID) #, with different data at same location sharing a sounding ID
- frequency, in hertz
- Standard error, in data units
- coil configration, 1 for vertical dipole, 2 for horizontal dipole, or 3 for both
- list of apparent conductivity values for each frequency, in milliSiemens/meter


2) Initial model.dat: A text (ascii) file containing initial FEMIC models for this example, with columns of:
- x location in meters
- y location in meters
- z location in meters
- sounding identification
- layer number
- initial conductivity value, in milliSiemens/meter for each layer 
- additional rows for alternative starting models
